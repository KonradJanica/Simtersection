Bug: Taxis do not stop at a taxi stand and drop off and/or pick up passengers randomly.

Bug fix completed. Detailed bug fix step-by-step can be found in the "notes" file included in this directory.

Decided bug fix was complete by running the GUI non-stop for 15 minutes at a decent speed to try and catch thrown exceptions with the use of else statements and system.print.ln. 

Another initial method of concluding the bug was indeed fixed was to observe the passengers at a slow tick rate to see if they were positioning correctly and being removed/added as necessary.

The last method used was to physically draw (using .drawRect/.drawOval) all the implemented Rectangle2D objects as well as other X/Y co-ordinates used by the bug fix coding. This allows initial graphical feedback to check that Pedestrians are being caught in the loadingArea (queue) correctly and are working as intended.

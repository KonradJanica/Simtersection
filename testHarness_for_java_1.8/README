v1 testHarness

Testing:
	1) Boundary/equivalence cases for Pedestrian waiting zone.
	2) Taxi pick-ups dynamically by user input 
		NOTE: "Passed!" means (final amount of pedestrians waiting) = (amount of pedestrians waiting - amount of taxis spawned)
			With negative summations changing to 0. 

Instructions:
	To run, in terminal (with correct directory) execute command "java test"
	And follow prompts.
	Stop and Start buttons can be used at anytime to restart tests using same user input.

NOTE: Simulation can be sped up using slider but results may vary.
